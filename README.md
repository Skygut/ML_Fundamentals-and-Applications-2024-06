Overview
Welcome to the final project, which will be a summary and consolidation of all your skills acquired during the course.

At the final stage of training, an interesting task awaits you - work with the database of anonymized marketing data of a real telecommunications company.

The main goal of the final course project is to predict which customers of the company may consider changing their service provider (according to a well-known marketing term, this is "customer churn").

Thus, your task is to develop an effective predictive model that can handle a large number of input features. You must demonstrate your ability to work with a volume and variety of data that includes both numerical and categorical features, while paying attention to class imbalances.

This final project is not just the completion of the course, but an opportunity to use your knowledge in practice. Success in it will not only highlight your achievements, but also prepare you for further challenges in the world of machine learning.

Do not doubt yourself - you are capable of analyzing data and making predictions even in the most difficult conditions!
